The manufacturing industry is constantly seeking ways to improve efficiency, reduce downtime, and save costs. Predictive maintenance, which uses data analysis and machine learning algorithms to predict equipment failure before it happens, has become an essential tool for achieving these goals.

With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, predictive maintenance has become even more effective. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data from sensors and other sources to identify patterns that indicate potential equipment failures. This allows maintenance personnel to schedule repairs proactively, reducing downtime and saving costs.

This book aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the use of AI in predictive maintenance, with a focus on reducing downtime and costs in the manufacturing industry. The book will explore different aspects of predictive maintenance, including failure prediction, maintenance planning, and spare parts management, as well as best practices for implementing AI in these areas.

Overall, this book is intended to be a valuable resource for researchers, engineers, policymakers, and students interested in the field of predictive maintenance and its applications. It is our hope that this book will contribute to the development of more efficient and effective manufacturing processes using AI technology.
